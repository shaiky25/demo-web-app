[Iteration 4]
The quality check identified a high severity issue with the button having id="increment" - it has no visible text, which makes the functionality unclear to users. This should be addressed before deployment.

In summary:
- The critical elements for the counter functionality are present, including the increment, decrement, and reset buttons, as well as the count element.
- However, the increment button is missing visible text, which is a high severity issue that needs to be fixed.
- The JavaScript functionality test passed, indicating the app.js script is loading properly.
- No other major issues were identified, but the missing text on the increment button should be addressed before deployment.
