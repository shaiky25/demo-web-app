feat: Replace workflow_dispatch with issue-based approval system

BREAKING CHANGE: Override mechanism changed from manual workflow dispatch to automatic GitHub issue creation

## What Changed

### Before
- Deployment blocked → Go to Actions → Run workflow → Fill form → Deploy
- Required production-override environment
- Manual process with multiple steps
- Hard to track approvals

### After  
- Deployment blocked → Issue auto-created → Comment "approve: reason" → Deploy
- Automatic issue creation with full context
- Simple comment-based approval
- Complete audit trail in issues

## New Features

1. **Automatic Issue Creation**
   - Creates GitHub issue when deployment blocked
   - Includes all AI analysis details
   - Labels: deployment-blocked, ai-analysis, needs-review
   - Links to commit and workflow run

2. **Comment-Based Approval**
   - Just comment: `approve: [your reason]`
   - Workflow checks every 30 seconds
   - Deploys automatically when approved
   - Issue closes with approval logged

3. **Team Collaboration**
   - Discuss issues in comments
   - Multiple team members can review
   - Visible decision-making process
   - Searchable approval history

4. **Timeout Protection**
   - Waits 60 minutes for approval
   - Fails gracefully if no approval
   - Can re-run after commenting

5. **Complete Audit Trail**
   - All approvals in issue history
   - Permanent record of decisions
   - Searchable and filterable
   - Linked to specific commits

## Technical Changes

### Workflow Changes
- Removed workflow_dispatch inputs
- Added create-approval-issue job
- Added wait-for-approval job with polling
- Updated deploy-production dependencies
- Fixed YAML syntax (template literals → string concatenation)

### New Jobs
1. `create-approval-issue` - Creates GitHub issue with details
2. `wait-for-approval` - Polls for approval comment (60 min timeout)
3. `deploy-production` - Deploys if passed or approved

### Removed
- workflow_dispatch trigger inputs
- production-override environment requirement
- Manual approval gate

## Documentation

### New Guides
- ISSUE-BASED-APPROVAL-GUIDE.md - Complete approval system guide
- WHATS-NEW.md - Migration and benefits guide

### Updated Guides
- README.md - Updated workflow diagram and override section
- TESTING-GUIDE.md - Updated test scenarios
- QUICK-START.md - Updated setup and testing steps

## Benefits

### For Developers
✅ Simpler approval (just comment)
✅ All context in one place
✅ No form filling
✅ Faster process

### For Teams
✅ Better collaboration
✅ Visible decisions
✅ Easy tracking
✅ Searchable history

### For Compliance
✅ Permanent audit trail
✅ Who, when, why logged
✅ Linked to issues
✅ Timestamped records

## Migration

### No Breaking Changes for Users
- Same API key requirement
- Same GitHub Pages setup
- Same AI analysis process

### What's Removed
- production-override environment (no longer needed)
- Manual workflow dispatch (replaced with issues)

### What to Update
- Team documentation
- Training materials
- Remove workflow_dispatch references

## Usage

### When Deployment Blocked

1. Issue automatically created
2. Review issue details
3. Comment: `approve: [your reason]`
4. Deployment proceeds automatically

### Example Approval
```
approve: False positive - buttons are in separate sections with clear context
```

### Finding Issues
- All blocks: `label:deployment-blocked`
- Approved: `label:approved-override is:closed`
- Recent: `label:deployment-blocked is:open`

## Testing

Push code with issues to test:
1. AI blocks deployment
2. Issue created automatically
3. Comment to approve
4. Deployment proceeds
5. Issue closes

## Files Changed

Modified:
- .github/workflows/ai-gated-deployment.yml (issue-based approval)
- README.md (updated workflow and override docs)
- TESTING-GUIDE.md (updated test scenarios)
- QUICK-START.md (updated setup steps)

Added:
- ISSUE-BASED-APPROVAL-GUIDE.md (complete guide)
- WHATS-NEW.md (migration guide)

## Validation

✅ YAML syntax validated
✅ Workflow structure verified
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Examples provided
✅ Migration guide created

This change significantly improves the developer experience by making
deployment approval as simple as commenting on an automatically created
GitHub issue, while providing better tracking and team collaboration.
